              <p>Avoid contact with polluted water as it can make humans and animals sick. Indeed the measured bacteria level from the waste of humans, animals and residual materials in the water is higher until 48 hours after an overflow. This rise in bacteria can be the cause of different infections such as E Colis, trachoma and hepatitis A to name a few. In addition, the waters can have a foul odor, making the water activities much less pleasant.</p>

                <p>Water and filtration systems receive water from commercial, domestic and industrial sources. During periods of heavy rainfall, it is not uncommon for systems to be overwhelmed. By limiting your water supply to the filtration system it is possible to reduce the gravity or even to avoid an overflow. Among the activities to avoid, the following are easy to move: use of the shower, the washing machine and the washer.</p>
